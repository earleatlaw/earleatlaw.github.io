This repository uses GitHub Pages to host the website for
[earle.law](https://earle.law), which is a React-based
Single Page Application (SPA).

It also makes use of the suggestions found at
[rafgraph/spa-github-pages](https://github.com/rafgraph/spa-github-pages)
in order to make the hosted SPA work for direct links to sub-pages.
